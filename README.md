## What is BazFlightZoom?

BazFlightZoom automatically zooms out your game camera and minimap when you take flight on a flying mount or dragonriding. When you dismount, both are smoothly restored to their previous zoom levels. Ground mounts are ignored.

Simple, lightweight, no configuration required — just install and fly.

## Features

- **Camera zoom out** — automatically zooms to max camera distance when airborne
- **Minimap zoom out** — zooms the minimap to maximum range for better navigation while flying
- **Smart detection** — only triggers on flying mounts, not ground mounts
- **Remembers your zoom** — saves your exact camera distance and minimap zoom before changing them
- **Clean restore** — returns to your previous zoom levels on dismount
- **Per-feature toggles** — independently enable/disable camera zoom and minimap zoom
- **Zero dependencies** — no libraries, completely standalone
